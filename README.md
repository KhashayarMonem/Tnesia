Tnesia
======

Tnesia is a time-series data storage based on Mnesia. You can run time-based queries on a large amount of data, without scanning the whole set of data, in a key-value manner.

Goal and Theory
-----
The goal is to reduce disk seeks in order to find a time range of data values in a timeline, ascending or descending, and from or to any arbitrary points of time.
There are few terms that can help you to understand how Tnesia stores and retrieves data, among them **Timeline**, **Timepoint** and **Timestep** are the main ones.

```

**Quick Facts**:

* Each timestep can contain arbitrary number of timepoints.
* All the orders are based on microsecond UNIX timestamp.
* Timepoints are just a pointer to its data value which stores somewhere else.
* Timepoints, as index, are stored on RAM to faster lookup.
* Data values are stored on Disk to have more room for storage.
* All seeks are **key-value**.
* Timestep precision is configurable depends on the timepoints frequency.

API
-----

**Write**

```erlang
write(Timeline, Record) -> {Timeline, Timepoint}
```

**Read**

```erlang
tnesia_api:read(Timeline, Timepoint) -> Record
```

**Remove**

```erlang
tnesia_api:remove(Timeline, Timepoint) -> ok
```

**Query fetch**

```erlang
tnesia_api:query_fetch(Query) -> [Record]
```

**Query filtermap**

```erlang
tnesia_api:query_filtermap(Query, FiltermapFun) -> [Record]
```

**Query foreach**

```erlang
tnesia_api:query_foreach(Query, ForeachFun) -> ok
```

**Query raw**

```erlang
tnesia_api:query_raw(Query, Return, Fun) -> [Record] | ok
```

Types
----

```erlang
Timeline = Record = any()
Timepoint = integer()
Query = [{timeline, Timeline},
         {since, Since},
         {till, Till},
         {order, Order},
         {limit, Limit}]
Since = Till = integer()
Order = asc | des
Limit = integer()
FiltermapFun = fun((RecordIndex, Record, Limit) -> {true, Record} | false)
ForeachFun = fun((RecordIndex, Record, Limit) -> any())
Fun = FiltermapFun | ForeachFun
Return = true | false
```
